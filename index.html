<p>The QueueMetrics wallboard is functional but it also looks ugly and can be quite hard to read. This is my effort to make things a little better.</p>

<h3>
<a name="so-this-code-is-fantastically-stable" class="anchor" href="#so-this-code-is-fantastically-stable"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So this code is fantastically stable?</h3>

<p>Well I've been using it in production for a couple of years and it works fine but I would advise extensive testing before going live with it.</p>

<p>Missing things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Error handling - it doesn't break gracefully at all</li>
<li>A more efficient way of querying the QueueMetrics server</li>
<li>I haven't built any tests</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="whats-it-made-of" class="anchor" href="#whats-it-made-of"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's it made of?</h3>

<ul>
<li>It's written in Ruby</li>
<li>It uses QM's XMLRPC API (alphabet soup!) to query real-time data.  This is done by a simple class I created.<br>
</li>
<li>It uses Sinatra and HAML to present that data to a browser, and JQuery to update the data</li>
<li>I've used Blueprint CSS to get a quick, sane page layout but I may drop that as it's 
complete overkill</li>
<li>It's using JQuery 1.6.4 for the AJAX refreshing </li>
<li>I've used the following document as the basis for much of this so credit where it's due:

<li>The colour scheme is taken from here:

<a name="how-do-i-make-this-work" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-make-this-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I make this work?</h3>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A running and installed QueueMetrics server </li>
<li>Any OS that can run Ruby (both 1.8.7 and 1.9 seem to work fine)</li>
<li>The following Ruby gems: Sinatra, HAML, Configatron</li>
<li>The files in this repository </li>
</ul><p>You need to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the files to a folder (maintaining the folder structure)</li>
<li>Edit config.yml so that it has the following info: 

<ul>
<li>Server and port are the ip address and port of your server, which should be clearly visible in the QM URL.  The path probably doesn't need to change.<br>
</li>
<li>Queue is the queue you want to manage, as seen in the QM application.<br>
</li>
<li>User and password is the credentials you use to login to QM (you should create an account specially for your wallboard).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To test the app just do the following: <code>ruby qm_web.rb</code>
</li>
<li>If you want to run this in a more permanent manner then you'll need to look into running Sinatra apps on your web server of choice. I've been using Apache and Phusion Passenger. </li>
</ul><p>Some things you might want to change:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wallboard updates every ten seconds.  If you edit ./views/index.haml you can change the values in the javascript block from 10000 to anything you wish.  I wouldn't recommend setting it lower than that.</li>
<li>You can change the default font size.  If you edit ./public/css/style.css you can change the font-size in the body block and this will change everything else proportionally.</li>
</ul>
